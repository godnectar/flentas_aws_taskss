1)Why cost monitoring is important for beginners?
AWS expenses can increase rapidly if resources are accidentally left operational. Many services persist in charging even when they are not actively utilized (like EC2, RDS, NAT Gateway, Elastic IP, and S3 storage). Without appropriate monitoring, you might exceed the Free Tier limits or overlook shutting down resources, resulting in unanticipated bills. Monitoring costs is vital for tracking usage, staying within budget, preventing surprises, and learning responsible cloud usage from the first day.

2)What causes sudden increases in AWS bills?
Sudden spikes in AWS bills usually happen due to:
a)Running EC2/RDS instances continuously.
b)NAT Gateway charges.
c)Data transfer charges.
d)Crossing Free Tier limits.
e)Misconfigured Auto Scaling.
