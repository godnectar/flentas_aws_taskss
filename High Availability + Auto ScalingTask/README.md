In this task, I deployed an Internet-facing Application Load Balancer (ALB) in the public subnets to handle incoming traffic, and then migrating the EC2 instances to private subnets so they are not directly exposed to the internet. I created an Auto Scaling Group (ASG) across 2 Availability Zones to ensure high availability, automatic scaling, and fault tolerance. The ASG was attached to the ALB through a target group so the ALB can intelligently route traffic to healthy EC2 instances running in the private subnets. Finally, I configured proper routing so that external users access the application through the ALB in public subnets, which forwards traffic securely to backend EC2 instances inside private subnets, ensuring both performance and security.
